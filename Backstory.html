                <h2>Her side</h2>
                <p>
                    We were both still in high school when we started dating. I was grade 9 and Vorster was matric. 

                    Vorster did not have anyone to go with to the matric dance and so he asked me. I said yes and was super excited that I got to go to a matric dance. 
                    
                    That night we had lot of fun but most of all we released how much we had in common and continued talking daily thereafter. 
                    Three months later Vorster asked me on a date and the rest is history.

                <h2>His side</h2>
                <p>
                    I had a crush on Rianca since I met her for the first time when I was grade 11. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I wanted to ask her out since that day but never had the courage. When I could find anybody for the matric dance (on purpose) I saw this as my opportunity. We had lots of fun and I knew I wanted to see her again so I waited a while and asked her on a date. And now we are here 7 years later and I get to call the girl I had a crush on my wife.
